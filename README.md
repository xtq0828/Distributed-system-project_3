For this project, I extend Project #2 in two distinct ways. 

1)Replicate my Key-Value Store Server across 5 distinct servers.  In project #2, I used a single instance of a Key-Value Store server.  Now, to increase Server bandwidth and ensure availability, I replicate your key-value store at each of 5 different instances of my servers.   Note that my client code should not have to change radically, only in that my clients should be able to contact any of the five KV replica servers instead of a single server and get consistent data back from any of the replicas (in the case of GETs).  My client should also be able to issue PUT operations and DELETE operations to any of the five replicas.    

2)On PUT or DELETE operations I ensure each of the replicated KV stores at each replica is consistent.  To do this, I implement a two-phase protocol for updates.  I assume no servers will fail such that 2 Phase Commit will not stall, although I can also defensively code my 2PC protocol with timeouts to be sure.  Consequently, whenever a client issues a PUT or a DELETE to *any* server replica, that receiving replica will ensure the updates have been received (via ACKs) and commited (via Go messages with accompanying ACKs).
